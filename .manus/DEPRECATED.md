# DEPRECATED - Manus AI Has Been Removed

This directory was used for Manus AI integration and is no longer needed.

All Manus references have been completely removed from the Roguard project:
- Removed Manus AI components
- Removed debug collector
- Removed vite-plugin-manus-runtime
- Replaced OAuth with email/password authentication
- Integrated advanced obfuscation engine (v2.0)

This directory can be safely deleted.

See `/MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for details on the migration.
